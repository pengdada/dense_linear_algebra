# 1. Code sample name
pddp2means

# 2. Description of the code sample package
Clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such way
that objects assigned in the same group exhibit greater similarity
than those located, according to some computable criterion of
similarity. Our approach on designing a parallel clustering algorithm optimized for the Intel Xeon-Phi
coprocessor.

Our implementation is based on the Principal Direction Divisive Partitioning (PDDP) 2-means algorithm. 

The steps of the implementation include:

1. Create a binary tree.
2. Find a splittable leaf with the greatest scatter value to use pddp 2 means algorithm on.
3. Find an approximation of the dominant eigenvector v of the matrix leaf(data)â€“leaf(centroid) using the power iteration algorithm.
4. Use the values of vector v to initialize the 2 means algorithm by creating a first set of clusters.
5. Use the result of 2-means to split the cluster of the leaf parent into two new clusters one for each leaf child.
6. Repeat steps 2. to 5. until you have the amount of clusters wanted.

This algorithm provided very stable and accurate solutions for the clustering problem (in terms of the Dunn Index metric).

Additional pre-requisites:
* Intel Compiles Suite
* Intel Xeon Phi
